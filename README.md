This is a website I have started building simply as an exercise, and for fun of course.

I will eventually build this to be fully functional on front and back end.

Currently on 6/6/17 I have been working on the front-end to make an attractive and functional site. It has a ways to come yet, but it's in progress.

Working on writing a grid system to incorporate on the site, not using an external framework.
